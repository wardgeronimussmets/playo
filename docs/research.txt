The main idea is to create an app that you can program to scan for a specific wifi network.
If it has found this network, it will connect and send a message via whatsapp to the person
that you wanted to send the message to.
Example use: "I've arrived safely at home"

further developments:
use gps to check if the person is getting close to the target place.

plan of execution:
first see if you can get a program to do something in the background
then see if you can turn on wifi and scan for wifi networks
then see if you can send messages with whatsapp
